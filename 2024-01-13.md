I had an awesome windfoiling session at Kyeemagh today. The wind was strong enough but not too strong, there was an area free of jelly fish and Aga was filming me with her old camera from ashore. The videos turned out to be much better than those taken by IPhone. I managed to practice  jibing and had a decent success rate (I would guess around 60+%).  There was only one minor annoyance -- too many jet skis. They were riding where the wingers were hanging out creating a bit of a chop and generally were a nuisance . 

Today I was using Strava to track the activity. It was accurate enough plotting my path and working out the average speed. However, it said my top speed was 81km/h which is obviously incorrect. I will use both Surfr and Strava in the next couple of sessions (but not together as it is impossible for both of them to be recording the same session). Then I will decide which I should stick with.
