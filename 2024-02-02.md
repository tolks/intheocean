Back on the water today. I was swimming with my mom at Little Bay. Perfect introduction to water activities after a 2 day break. I saw 2 small stingrays. There were the same colour as the send and you could only notice them if you were swimming close and they were moving a bit. Otherwise they were camouflaged very well.
