There was a good wind forcasted for today and I was eager to resume my attempts to learn wingfoiling tacks. Unfortunately the strong wind didn't eventuate. I still went out foiling but for the most of the session I was trying to get on foil and stay on foil when jibing. Getting on foil wasn't easy and I spent large amount of time taxiing and waiting for wind gusts. Because of waiting and taxiing my average speed for the session was only 10km/h. At least I got a good workout trying to pump on foil in light wind many many times :). 
I still need to learn better pumping technique that would allow me to struggle less in light wind.
