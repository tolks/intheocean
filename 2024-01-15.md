I continued self imposed brake from wingfoiling today. Even if I wanted to foil the wind was way too strong for my gear blowing at 25+kt. 

To continue my on-the-water streak, I went to Maroubra beach for a swim. The beach itself was closed due to large waves so I used the rock pool. There were not too many people in the pool. Perfect way to enjoy the ocean in Sydney!
