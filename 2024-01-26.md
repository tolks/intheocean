Today I used my new foil the first time. I kept the old stab and put on the new front wing. The wind was very strong which ended up being a double edge sward. Because of the strong wind it was easy to get on foil even with the smaller front wing. However the wind created the biggest chop I ever experienced and it made other things more difficult. I have fallen down several times while getting on the board, overfilled and fallen in because of the waves' picks and troughs, my success rate in jibing was quite low too. Overall I spent a lot of time in the water which is reflected in my average speed of the session: 8km/h. 

All in all I expected to struggle with my new foil and I did a bit. The ideal conditions would've been the same or slightly lower wind speed but different direction which would've resulted in less waves. I am looking forward to such conditions!
