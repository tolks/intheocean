The every-day-on-the-water streak continues with some more swimming today. I took my mom to Little Bay. There were much fewer people there compared to last time with only a few in the water. Maybe because it was a week day and a bit of an overcast. 

My new foil got delivered today. Now i wait for a strong wind to try it out. Maybe tomorrow...
