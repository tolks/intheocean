3rd day of wingfoiling in a row. Today I went to Kyeemagh. 20kn southerly wind was blowing which meant it was an onshore conditions with a lot of bumps. I was using the 1250 foil with the old shimmed tail. The shimmed tail helped me a lot because the wind blown bumps were making the conditions tricky for me. 

My 5.5m wind wing was too big for conditions but with the harness it was manageable. I tried to ride the bumps a bit without much success, if I was riding directly down the bump I was quickly overtaking it and hitting the next bump with the board. The bumps have very low period and I cannot adjust my flight to get over the next bump. What I could do is to try to still ride the bump down sideways while still keeping the wind somewhat powered. I would de-power the wing a little and turn more downwind, catch a way go with it for a second and then power back on. It was a new, fun experience for me. 
I still wasn't making as many gybes as I was in flat water, but the old tail helped me to make at least 50% of them. I was expecting to improve a bit faster and start learning tacks but still need to practice.

I also found out there were a lot of wingers in Malabar today. I should try Malabar in such conditions as I imagine there will be no chop there in Southerly.
