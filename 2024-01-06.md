Today was my best wingfoiling session so far. Great wind, not too many jelly fish and the improvised harness, all made for a very enjoyable afternoon on the water. 
Before the harness I had to take short breaks because my forearms would be extremely tired after 15 min. With the harness I was able to spend 1h40min on the water without stops. I could also go sharper up wind, so I was not afraid of ending up downwind on the beach and walking back (as I had done before on multiple occasions).

The wind was strong than yesterday too which made jibing easier. I reckon I made about quarter of the attempted jibes!!!!
