Today a very strong Southerly wind and brought some rain. In the afternoon it stopped raining and there was an opportunity to go foiling. Unfortunately it was too strong for my gear. I know those with the right gear and strong skills enjoyed the wave session in La Perouse. Even if I had the right gear I don't think I would've been able to foil in strong waves and chop.
