Another wind foiling day for me. The session started with the light-ish wind but it then built up to what I would consider close to perfect. 

Because the start of the session was light, I only got to practicing tacks at the end when I was more tired. This is my excuse for only making 2 foiling tacks out of many attempts. Well..., I will continue trying.

Unfortunately I pulled my arm muscle a bit so I think I will stop foiling for several days.
