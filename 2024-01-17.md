After a 3 day break from wingfoiling I was back at Kyeemagh today. The wind was quite strong but still suitable for my gear. The gusts went up to 23 knots. I spent time practising jibing and attempted a couple of tacks. The jibing practice was quite successful, I was making ~70+% of them. The tacks on the other hand were a complete failure -- every single attempt ended up with me falling in. I would need to practice on land before I attempt them on the water again.

For this session I shimmed my stabiliser by .5 degree. It didn't make a big difference given I was using .25 shim before. Maybe it does glide marginally better but I don't have enough experience to notice. 

I used Surfr to record the session again. This time my top speed was more believable at 23km/h. I think the last record of 34km/h was just miss measured, my foil is not capable of going that fast. 
Compared to the last session I measured with Surfr my average speed was higher -- this is simply because I was falling less often.
