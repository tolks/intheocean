Today for my water activity I went to Little Bay and had a swim. I took my mom with me. Little Bay is a sheltered beach with no waves which makes it perfect for swimming. My mom doesn't go to the beaches with waves so her options are either beaches in Sydney Harbour, Botany Bay or a couple of sheltered ocean. Little Bay is one of such sheltered beaches and it is relatively close for both me and my mom.
