Couple of days ago I emailed a local water sports shop about trying a smaller board. I want to switch from my current 110 litres, 30 inches wide board to something smaller. I don't know yet what the size or shape I should be getting and asked the shop if they had something around 70-90 litres to try before buying. They only had a 60 litres board to demo. Today the strong Southerly wind was blowing and I decided to try the small board they had. I watched a lot of videos on how to start a smaller board in choppy water and had all theoretical knowledge prepared. 

In practice, it was a nightmare. For 2 hours I was trying to get on my knees on a tiny board only to fall down into the water again and again. I would be  blown downwind and would walk back along the beach. I did manage to get on foil but only on 4 occasions and behind the rock jetty were there was no chop. Being afraid of going too far from the shore on the board that I cannot start I would try to gybe very quickly and inevitably fail. All together I think I spent 40sec on the foil out of the 2 hours in the water. 

Conclusion: it is too early for me to buy a 60l board.
