Aga and me had a nice walk around Maroubra and I had a great swim at the beach. The weather was cloudy and there were not too many people on the beach. 

There is no much wind forecasted for tomorrow so most likely there will be no wing foiling until Monday. It is good to have some break from foiling as it allows my tired legs to rest.
