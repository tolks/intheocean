No wingfoiling today, instead I had another swim. Took my mum and we went for a quick dip in Little Bay. Despite going their after 6pm there were a crowd both on the beach and in the water. More people than I have ever seen their. It is a small beach, I cannot imagine how crowded it was in the middle of the day. 

Well, it wasn't too bad once you swim out beyond 20m from the beach as almost all of the people tend to congregate their. We had a good swim overall.
