The North Easterly wind started blowing again and it meant Kyeemagh was a great location to go. I went there at 3pm and had an extra long session. All together I spent two and an half hours on the water and covered 44km. The wind was averaging 18 knots with good 20+kn gusts making it very easy to get on foil. For the first part of the session I was trying to sail fast averaging 19+km/h. Then I was trying to learn how to tack. I was using the new front wing and the old bigger tail for stability. And....... I managed to execute my first foiling tack! I really really wanted to get it this time as the conditions were perfect for learning. The session was so long because I kept trying and trying without success. I got 2 tacks where I touched down but kept a bit of speed and got on foil with a couple of pumps. Eventually I managed to execute one foiling tack.  It wasn't the prettiest as I almost dropped down but a gust of wind at the end kept me foiling. I was only attempting the toe-side tacks as they say they are easier.  In any case, I am very happy with the progress.
