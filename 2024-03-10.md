Tanguy is in Sydney this week and we arranged to have a foiling session together. He was going to rent the kite foiling gear and meet me at the the Monterey beach. The beach is not too far from my usual Kyeemagh spot. When we met the wind was somewhat iffy for my gear. It would've been probably ok if it was flat water but the kite foiling spot was choppy. We still had a very good session; Tanguy really enjoyed the foil he rented and his gear was perfect for the conditions. I, on other hand, got tired quickly from pumping on foil and only had an hour or so in the water.
