I had another winging session today. The wind was strong enough for gear but not as strong as the day before. Jelly fish problem was more severe than yesterday and only half way though the session I managed to find a spot with fewer of them. Nevertheless I continued improving my jibing and executed around 10 foiling jibes. That makes about 10-20% success rate. 

Having done 3 consecutive days of winging I feel really knackered. Even though there is a good wind forcast for tomorrow I will probably take a break from winging.
