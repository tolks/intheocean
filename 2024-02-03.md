After a 3 days break from wingfoiling I was itching to go back. The forcast was good and I almost went too early because I was extra keen. Aga was joining me today and because I had to wait for her I actually timed the session with the perfect wind: 18kt average with 21kt gusts. 
We went to Kyeemagh and there were already a lot of wingers on the water. I was using my new front wing and the new tail. The flat conditions meant that I could go pretty fast. Surprisingly the top speed this session was roughly the same as 2 sessions ago when I was using the larger tail in similar conditions. I was expecting to go faster with the new tail but probably still need to learn how to. Maybe the shim I used to speed up the old tail also made it faster than I though. 

I now had 5 sessions on the 1250 Fanatic Free front wing which is a big step down from my original Fanatic 2000 HA wing (it is called HA but its aspect ratio is just 5.9). In the first 3 sessions I used the new front wing and the old tail (300cm2) and in the last 2 I used both the new tail (250cm2) and the front wing.  
  
In 4 out of the 5 sessions the wind was strong so I had no troubles getting on foil. In one of the sessions I struggled a bit. Overall I feel I need extra 3-4kt of wind compared to the old foil. Hopefully as I improve my pumping technique I would be able to get up in less wind. Might also buy a narrower board in the future to help as well.  
  
I was quite surprised how stable things felt in the sessions when I used the new front wing and the old tail. I was able to gybe and switch feet with about the same success rate as before (70%). I think this is mostly because the wind was strong and it helped to offset small errors.  
  
  
Overall the new front wing is a bit faster than the old one. Before my fastest 1k had an average speed of 21.3km/h with the new set it was 23.4k/h. I expected more of a speed difference, maybe it is my technique that limits the speed, I also had the same top speed in the fastest km with both my old tail and the new tail, albeit the old tail had .5degree shim.  
  
  
The new foil together with the new tail feels much looser and pitchy. I need to pay a bit more attention to regulate the high. From the footage Aga took of me riding and I noticed I was going up and down and not keeping constant height. Something that I still need to improve, I wonder if there are any tips/tricks to improve this fast. The strong wind and flat water meant that I was still gybing quite ok.
