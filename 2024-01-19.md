I was planning to do wing foiling today the forecast was predicting good wind. Unfortunately the wind didn't eventuate and instead I went swimming in the ocean. Just like yesterday I took my mom and we went to Little Bay. The day was good and there were quite a few people on the small beach.  Surprisingly not too many kids, usually there are a lot of the in the sheltered beach during the holidays. 

It was great to have a cool swim during a very warm day.
