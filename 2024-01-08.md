There was no good wind for foiling today. I was still hopeful for the wind to pick up and even went to the beach and started setting up. The wind was getting stronger however it also started raining. I had no choice but to pack up as the rain was quite strong. 
Instead I went swimming in the ocean pool when the rain stopped. The pool was quite busy and it wasn't possible to swim laps; I just got in and got out in 5 mins when it became obvious that laps are out of the question. Still a good time in the water :) .
