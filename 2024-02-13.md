I wasn't sure if I would be able to have a wingfoiling session today. The forecasted winds were stronger than my gear would be able to handle. The wind strength readings in early afternoon showed that the wind was not as strong as forecasted so I decided to try my luck. I got on the water and the wind increased a lot making the session very challenging. I still rode for a bit more than an hour before admitting that fighting the strong winds all the time is not very enjoyable. I did try to practice tacking a bit and managed to execute 2 foiling tacks. I  did them during a bit of a lull when it was a bit easier to turn into the wind but there was still enough wind force to pull me out on the other side of the tack. That puts my total tack count at 3! All 3 of them where done from toe-side to goofy hill-side stance. I attempted other arrangements too but failed them pretty badly.

I wish I had a smaller wing, I would've been able to practice more. But the conditions forced me off the water. Tomorrow the forecast for even stronger winds so I am not planning to wingfoil.
