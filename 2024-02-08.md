After 2 day break there was a bit of a southerly wind and I went foiling again. I first checked Malabar as I've heard that some people wing there sometimes. There was only one prone foiler with a foildrive in the water and the wind was on the lighter side. Because Malabar bay is somewhat sheltered by high banks I though there will be even less wind in the bay. I asked that foiler when he came onshore if there was much wind on the water and he said it was almost nothing. 

Instead I went to La Perouse. It was somewhat windy there and I decided to try my luck with the new smaller foil and the new tail. It was a mistake. I kept struggling to pump on foil and when I would pump up I would only stay up until the next jibe. Because of the lighter wind and less stable foils it was really difficult to gybe for me. Throughout the whole session I might have made only 3 or 4 foiling gybes. This is also because each time I would fall it will take me 5 min or more to get back on foil. Overall it was a miserable session. Next time I will have to decide if in such conditions I should take a bigger foil and/or a bigger tail.
