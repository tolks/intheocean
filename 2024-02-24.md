Southerly wind started blowing at night and kept the strength throughout the day. At 8am the local wing foilers in the whatsapp group mentioned that some were going to Malabar. I have never tried Malabar before and decided to join them. By the time I got there at 10am there were 15 wings on the water. Malabar itself is a relatively narrow and long bay (the bay's name is actually Long Bay). There was a big swell coming in and wing blown chop on top of it. The experienced wingers like the place because they can ride the swell and the waves. It seemed like all the people in the water were quite experienced. 

With the swell and the wind chop it was really tricky conditions. In Malabar there is only a relatively short reaches you take across the narrow bay before you have to gybe or tack. If you gybe consistency in those conditions then it is not a problem, but it wasn't the case for me. I was falling in on every second gybe (if not more often) and only would spend on foil a minute before the next failed turn. I think I am not yet ready for such conditions. I spend 20 min or so in the water and called it a day. Next time in such conditions I should probably go to La Perouse. In La Perouse you can still try to learn to handle the chop and a bit of a swell. You can also take longer reaches there when you are tired of falling in and starting again.
