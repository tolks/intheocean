There was a very light wind forecasted for the day with a bit of a storm scheduled for a very late evening. I decided to go to Maroubra beach in the morning. The surf was quite big but they kept the beach opened. It was scary to swim out beyond the breaking waves, I was considering doing it but after getting tumbled by a broken wave I decided against it. Had a quick dip in the shallows and went home. 

Late in the afternoon the wind picked up and I was eager to take the foiling opportunities. Unfortunately by the time I got to the beach it started raining hard and the wind dropped. They predicted the rain but much later. I had to go back home; should've checked the rain radar before leaving.
