After 3 days of wingfoiling I was too tired to have another session even though there was good southerly wind blowing. In the morning the wind was too strong for my gear and when it eased up it started raining so I don't feel too bad about missing an opportunity. 
Instead I had a quick dip at my local beach. It was overcast, the rain was starting and there were not too many people at the beach. The water was very warm, I could've stayed in for longer but the wind blown chop was annoying. 5 min in the ocean still counts and the streak continues.
