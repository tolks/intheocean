Wingfoiling session brought me to Kyeemagh late in the afternoon today. The wind was very strong the whole day, too strong for my only 5.5m wing. I had to wait till later in the day before it eased a bit and I could go on the water. Although there were a lot of jelly fish in the water they all concentrated within a 50m wide area close to the shore. Once you passed the infested region the water was relatively jelly fish free. With the strong wind and clear water I was able to practice my jibes and got some success with it. Have probably made 6 or 7 successful foiling jibes during a very short session. 
My forearms still get very tired quickly; within 15 min of the start I felt I needed a break and had to cross the jelly-fish area to get to the shore. After a short break I did another ~20 min of foiling; that's when I got most of the success with jibing. 

Good session even though it was a bit tiring after the previous day's winging. 
I need to learn how to use harness which might make me stay in the water for longer.
