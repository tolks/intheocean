Today I went to La Perouse for a foiling session. As I got to the Yarra Bay beach I realised that it would be very difficult to enter the water there. Big rolling swell was entering Botany Bay and directly hitting the beach. Instead, I went to Frenchmen's beach three hundreds metres away. It is facing south-west and wasn't impacted by the swell. 

The wind was averaging 18kn with gusts to 23 making it quite easy to get on foil. However, those big ocean rollers were making gybing really difficult for me. I think my success rate during the session was 30% and it got to 30 only because I was gybing out closer to the beach where the swell wasn't as noticeable. I think I only made 2 or 3 gybes on the outside, the rest of the time I have fallen in because of the swell or chop. 
There were quite a lot of wingers out and some were really enjoying the swell. They would flag out and ride the swell for hundreds of mitres. I aim to get to the same level of skills even though it would be quite a few sessions before I can get there.
