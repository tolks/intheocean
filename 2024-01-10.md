I had another amazing wing foiling session today. Today I was at Kyaamagh where there is no chop when the NorthEasterly wind blows. Compared to choppy session yesterday it was much easier to make the jibes. I recon I made 75% of all my attempted jibes. There were some jelly fish that caused a couple of crashes but overall I could find clean water to practice.

I can definitely notice my progress over the last 2 weeks. All the time on the water shows. In the last 10 days since the new year I probably spent more time foiling than in the previous 6 months combined. The harness I got 5 days ago also helped a lot. It  allowed me to foil though the sessions non-stop and not waist time on breaks. I now feel I need to start looking at new foils to try :) .
