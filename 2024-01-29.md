Today was the best foiling session with the new foil by far. The wind was strong averaging 18kn and gusting up to 24 which meant I had no problems getting on foil. Strong wind and flat water at Kyeemagh also made gybing easier. With fewer falls I was able to record the personal best for my average speed -- 18.9km/h for the session. It would've been even higher if I didn't try to attempt 3 or 4 tacks. I failed on all of them and fallen in each time bar one when I dropped off the foil but stayed on the board. 

I was still using my old stabiliser(tail). I think it was the tail that was making a lot of noise once I went faster than certain speed. It wasn't a big problem with the old, big front foil as I would be able to hit the speed threshold only occasionally. The smaller foil is much faster meaning I had the noise following me almost the whole session. I will try the new tail the next time the wind is as good, hopefully it wouldn't produce as much noise. There is also some info online on what to do to make the noise disappear. It involves carefully sanding the trailing edge of the wing (the tail wing in my case based on my diagnosis). I am a little afraid to perform this operation; if not done properly at can damage the wing.
