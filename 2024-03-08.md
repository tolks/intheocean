I really wanted to get back to wingfoiling after a two day break. The knee felt good enough too. The wind forecast however wasn't promising; fortunately by 4 pm North Easterly picked up a bit and I went to Kyeemagh. It ended up being a great session. The wind was strong enough averaging 17kn with good gusts to make getting on foil easy; my knee was ok too although I felt it a bit when getting on the board. 

At the beginning of the session when it was a bit lighter I was mostly cruising without attempting any challenging manoeuvres. When the wind picked up I tried tacks and managed to execute foiling tacks 4 times. I think the wind being strong enough but not too strong allowed me to have a larger tack radius which made tacking a bit easier. I didn't attempt too many tacks so 4 out of about 15 attempts is a good progress.

There is a good forecast tomorrow. If my knee doesn't hurt I will try practicing tacks again.
