I had another wingfoiling session today.  I went to La Perouse; it is a bit closer to my place than Kyeemagh and a good foiling location in southerly winds. Most of the time I don't go there as it is impossible to park but because it was overcast in the morning the beach goers stayed at home and I didn't have problems finding a good parking spot. 

I had a new bit of equipment to try -- a self improvised harness. I bought the harness hook and the harness lines. I managed to put on the belt of my impact vest and attached the lines to the wing. This proved to be a good enough harness to try before committing to buying a proper one. Surprisingly it wasn't too difficult to hook in and out even though the harness line had a tendency to coil. I did fall down a couple of times when hooking in/out but overall it was a success. 
The wind was quite light so maybe it made it easier as well. Most of the session I was learning how to use harness and didn't spend time on jibing. Only made one foiling jibe; in the light wind the jibing is still very difficult for me.
