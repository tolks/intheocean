Today was especially productive day, I managed to go for a swim and then had a wingfoiling session in the afternoon. The forecast wasn't predicting a good wind so I took my mom and we went to Little Bay. Little Bay has a very sheltered  beach but just outside the bay you could see the big waves. The same swell that I was experiencing the day before inside Botany Bay. The waves looked very big when they were hitting the rocks, much more impressive than the big rollers I experienced in the bay.  We had a quick swim and went back home. 

Later in the afternoon the North Easterly wind picked up and I went foiling in Kyeemagh. At the start of the session it was a bit calm and I even came off the foil 2 times in lulls. But then the wind picked up and  was averaging 16kn and gusting up to 20. It was perfect wind strength for my equipment. After several challenging sessions I decided to cruise around instead of pushing to learn new things. After the session on a tiny board and the one in swell and chop when I crashed a lot it was great to feel more in control. I was making 90+% of my gybes and I wasn't attempting any tacks :). I did attempt one and have fallen in and hit my knee on the foil. The hit was exactly in the spot where I had a hole in my wetsuit so I ended up with a scratch and a bruise. I was treated by Aga with an antiseptic spray when I got back home. 

Because I didn't attempt any challenging maneuvers I wasn't falling in much and ended up with the highest average speed for the session -- 20.1km/h. I also recorded the fastest km -- 26.2km/h
