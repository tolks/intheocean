The wind forecast was predicting very little wind but just before mid-day it started blowing strong enough for me to have another wingfoiling session.  It is funny how much more time you can spend windfoiling if you  don't have to work and don't have other engagements. Just monitor the wind and go when it picks up :) . 

La Perouse was the location this time. Back in the chop meant that my success percentage in jibing went down dramatically. I probably was making 10-20% of my jibes. The wind was also not too strong which makes it tricker to jibe. In low winds you need to be more precise with wind handling and have to carry more speed on the jibe exit to continue foiling. I still have a lot to learn. 

The forcast says that there will be strong winds tomorrow -- lets see if I can go back to 75% success rate.
