Back to wingfoiling in La Perouse today. There was 19+knots strong Southerly wind, quite a lot of wing chop and a rolling swell that was entering the harbour. The chop and the swell made it much more difficult to jibe. Overall I was making just about 50% of foiling jibes which is much lower than in Kyeemagh without the chop or swell. 
This time I wasn't even attempting to do tacks as I would need flat conditions to practice. 

I wonder if my big foil makes dealing with chop more difficult. I have ordered a new much smaller front wing and a corresponding stabiliser. Once it arrives I will try and compare. They say that it will take me another several session to learn the new gear before I get to my current level of the old gear. But then it opens up much bigger opportunity to progress. I am looking forward to it and trying not to think about the miserable sessions of not being able to get on foil and crashing soon after you do :)
