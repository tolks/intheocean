I had a wingfoiling session at Kyeemahg today. There was a lot of jelly fish in the bay; I would occasionally hit them with my foil and fall into the water. Made the session less enjoyable but it was still pretty good. The wind was strong and I was able to practice jibing on foil. Made 6 jibes -- a good result.
