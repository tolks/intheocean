Having done a lot of wingfoiling lately I decided to take a break for at least 2 days. Even though there was a good wind I instead went and had a swim at Maroubra beach. Surprisingly there were already a lot of people at 8 am on Sunday morning. Most likely because there was a Surf Life Saving competition happening there. 

I had a quick dip in the ocean -- very enjoyable.
