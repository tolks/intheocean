The wind was as strong as forecasted: 24kn gusting over 30. Too strong for my gear; wingfoiling was out of the question. Instead I took my mom swimming at Little Bay. There were very few people on the usually crowded beach. The water was a bit colder, this is because strong swells brought the colder water into the bay. 
We had a very nice swim before the strong wind picked up.
