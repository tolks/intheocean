The North Easterly was blowing 15+ knots today which allowed me to wingfoil at Kyaamagh again. This time there was a lot of jelly fish all over the place. I couldn't find any clear areas making the session quite frustrating. I hit them and crashed many times. Even worse, trying to avoid them by riding very high on the mast I would breach and crash; it  happened at least twice. Arghhhh.
At least the new tracking app worked well. I subscribed to SURFR and it recorded my session. 1h30min in the water, 21km total distance and 31km/h max speed. I am not sure how accurate they are; I expected lower max speed and total distance .
