Today I had 2 water sessions swimming and wingfoiling. In the morning me and my mom went to CampCove. There were very few people and we had a great swim. It is a nice small beach in Sydney Harbour but a bit of a drive from my place so I rarely go their. I got stung by a jelly fish, there must have been only one of them in the water and I managed to bump into it.

Even though there was no wind forecasted it picked up towards the end of the day. On average it was around 15knots with small gusts up to 19 which was just enough for me to enjoy foiling but not enough to try tacking. I was going up and down and practiced jibing in lower wind. Luckily there was almost no jelly fish in Kyeemagh for the first time in ~6 months. All together I spent 1h11min in the water and did 18km -- pretty good average speed. This is largely because I didn't have to stay within a section and could have long reaches. Previously the jelly fish would force me to stay within the small areas on the water and jibe all the time which would reduce the average speed a lot.
