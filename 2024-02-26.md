Third day in a row we are treated with good winds. Today it was southerly which meant choppy conditions in any of the locations I wing. I chose La Perouse to practice gybing in messy chop. I went back to the 1200 cm² foil and corresponding 200 cm² tail. There was definitely enough wind to get me foiling on that gear even with the chop. I am still not great at gybing in messy seas, I think the main reason is that once I turn downwind I would get accelerated by a chop and would not have enough time to react. Sometimes I would overfoil and sometimes I would be pushed to the bump in front and would touch down which will slow me down and completely change the balance. I am getting better though, this time I probably made 60% of the gybes. 

Lately I have been switching foils quite a bit, both the front wings and tails. I used the 2000 cm² one in light wind, yesterday I was on the newly purchased high aspect one and today I went back to the mid aspect 1200 cm² foil. They are all different and require some technique adjustments. I think I want to stick with 1200 cm² foil for a bit to get used to how it feels and nail the gybes in all conditions. Once my gybing success is 90%+ and can tack confidently I would try to ride swell and wind bumps which probably require the high aspect foil.  Hopefully I can get there soon.
