A day without rain at last! I took the opportunity to go for a swim with my mum. We went to Little Bay around 3pm and had a quick dip. It was great to get into the water after a longish break. 
Later in the afternoon the wind picked up just a little bit. It was averaging ~13kn with 15kn gusts. Normally I wouldn't go out in such wind and would wait for it to build up. But after a 9 days of not foiling I was keen. I also hoped the wind would increase a bit towards the evening (it didn't). I went to Kyeemagh and rigged up my old big 2000cm foil and big stab as well. With the big foil it was possible to get foiling when a gust would come. There were times in the session where I would wait for a gust for several minutes but overall it wasn't too bad. 

Getting used to the big foil again wasn't easy, I felt a little unsure especially at the start. The light wind also made it more difficult to gybe and surprisingly I was falling in way more often than I expected. I think I was making 60% of my gybes even though there was no chop at all. I attempted to tack twice but failed. With the big foil and light wind it wasn't going to happen.
