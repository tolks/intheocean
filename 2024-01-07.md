Today was very windy. So much so that I was debating with myself if the wind is too strong for my wingfoiling gear. At the end I still went to Kyeemagh and had a very quick wingfoiling session. Within 20 minutes on the water I realised that the wind was too strong for the 5.5m wing -- it was a struggle to keep the wind force in check even with the harness. I did manage to execute a couple of wing foiling jibes some of which were recorded. Aga went with me a filmed me a bit from the shore. With only the phone and no lenses it is difficult to actually use those clips for learning but still a good evidence of my progress :) .
