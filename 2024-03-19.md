After a longish break I had a wingfoiling session at Kyeemagh today. I was so keen that I went there before the wind really kicked in. The first part of the session was light and I spent a lot of efforts pumping. The second part of the session had much stronger wind. I was a bit tired by then and didn't have much success in practicing tacking. Could only do 2 foiling tacks. It felt that I regressed a bit after a week long break.
