Another wingfoiling session at La Perouse. The wind was much stronger today and I had no problems getting on foil. After a bad session yesterday I also decided to switch back to the old tail. With the bigger tail it is easier to maintain the right hight and it was supposed to help me gybing. It was good that I switched the tail as the state of the ocean was very messy. There was a lot of wind blown chop and also in some areas there were big rollers. With the chop and the swell the gybing was difficult even with the bigger tail. I probably made 50% of my gybes, with the new tail I probably would've been falling in much more often. I will switch back to the new tail when I wingfoil in North Easterly at Kyeemagh. It would be flatter and even the last time with the new tail I was able to gybe quite well when it was flat. 

I also noticed that I am a bit more comfortable riding on a port tack. It is strange because I always though that I had a goofy stance. At the same time it is easier for me to gybe from starboard to port (that's maybe where my goofy stance shows a bit). I never ride toe-side for longer than 50 meters, whenever I come out from a gybe I switch feet. So I don't even know what my gybing preference from heal-side is.
