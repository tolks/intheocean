There was strongish North Easterly wind today averaging 18kn with gusts up to 23kn. Kyeemagh was perfect for practicing in flat water. I had a 2.5h long session on the  1200 cmÂ² foil and 250 cmÂ² tail. I again experienced that it is order of magnitude easier to gybe in stronger winds on flat water. I reckon my gybe success rate was above 90% and I used the first part of the session just to cruse around. Then I tried tacking... Unfortunately, this manoeuvre is still very difficult for me. I only made one foiling tack out of dozens of attempts. I think I should've tried practicing tacking from the very start when I was fresh. The more tired I got, the worse my attempts became. 

I count the one tack I made as progress. Another couple of sessions in good conditions like today and I would improve my tacking rate to at least 10% ðŸ˜ƒ .
