I bought a new front wing and a corresponding stab today. Couldn't pass up the opportunity to get a high aspect 1305 cm² foil for a good price. I think I would want to use it to learn how to ride small waves. 

The wind in the afternoon picked up a bit and gave me an excuse to play with my latest toy. I went to Kyeemagh and had a reasonable session. The foil felt somewhat different than my other foils. I needed slightly different starting technique to avoid stalling, I had to put more pressure on the front as soon as the foil would start to come up. I will also have to play with the positions of the mast as I sensed it needed to be pushed forward compared to my previous front wings. Gybing was trickier too and I was making probably 50 % in flat water (compared to 80+% before). The smaller stabiliser was making it more difficult to control the pitch which was the main reason for the low gybing success, I also had to adjust the turning radius. I think it would be easier in higher winds as I was backwinded several times during gybes (should definitely learn how to heineken gybe). The glide was very good when I could consistency control the pitch. My fastest kilometre was just over 23km/h and I think I would easily beat it by a lot if I actually try. The wind was averaging 15kn, with this foil I had to wait for gusts to get up (which were far between). I wonder if it has lower starting speed than my 1200 cm² foil. I'd imagine they are about the same but I only tried the 1200 cm² foil in 18kn+ wind so far.
