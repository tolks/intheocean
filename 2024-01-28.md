I went wingfoiling in La Perouse today. The wind was just marginal for my skills and my new foil. On the old foil I would've had no problems getting on foil but with the new smaller one I straggled a lot in a bit of a chop. At the beginning I was able to get on foil quickly because I was fresh and there was a good gust. However I have fallen in on my first gybe and then had to try to pump up again and again. I was taxing up and down slowly drifting downwind and trying to pop up on each gust. It was really tiring. I would sometimes be able to pop up but would come down again in gybes. Thankfully the wind increased a bit and I had good 15-20 min when I was on foil and doing several successful gybes in a row. That's when I was able to make up ground upwind so I didn't have to walk back and carry my gear.  

Although it was only a 1h10min long session I was the most exhausted i'd ever been after foiling. The unsuccessful pumping again and again made me feel like I was in the water for 5 hours. I guess I need to improve my skills.
