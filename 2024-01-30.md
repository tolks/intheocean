Even though the forecast was predicting no wind whatsoever it started blowing quite strong in the late morning. I took my gear, put the new stab and went to La Perouse. The wind became even stronger by the time I got in the water. With such a strong wind there was a lot of chop but even with the chop the wing would just pull be on foil as soon as I would sheet in. It was blowing hard. So much so that I was struggling to control the wing, and with the big chop on top of it the enjoyment level wasn't very high. The chop and the new tail made it trickier for me to gybe too, I was coming down quite a lot. 
On the positive side -- no whistling with the new tail. Maybe because I wasn't going fast enough but more likely because the new tail has a better finish on its trailing edge. We will know for sure the next time I will try it in flat water. 

All in all -- reasonable session, albeit with lots of falls. The average speed was 10km/h. I would need a smaller wing not to be overpowered in such strong wind, but with the smaller wing I wouldn't want to struggle and would need to get on foil more efficiently. Maybe I should consider new narrow board. They say say they are easier to get foiling on.
