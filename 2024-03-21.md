The wind from yesterday was still blowing this morning but it was lighter than yesterday -- good enough for my gear. I went to La Perouse and had a quick session. Unfortunately, the wind was very gusty and the chop was making it quite difficult for my skills. I would need to wait for a bit to get up on foil and would come down off foil in lulls. I was also straggling to jybe more than I usually struggle in this conditions.  The only highlight of the session was a school of fish that I saw :) . ![[Pasted image 20240321204143.png]]
