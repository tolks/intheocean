After 2 days break from wingfoiling I was keen to get back to practicing new moves on the water. The wind was good and I went to Kyeemagh in early afternoon. There were quite a few wingers on the water and most of them congregated in the same area. There were a lot of jelly fish about 400 meters from the beach and everyone preferred to stay within 400x300 area which was relatively jelly fish free. There were still enough place to practice but it was a bit tighter than I have seen before and it was even more important to check the blind spots before turning. 

I tried to use the good wing to learn tacking. Prior to going winging I went to a local netball courts with a skateboard and a wing and spend ~30 min wing skating and practicing wing handling during tacks. It was supposed to build muscle memory for wing transitions. On the water, all together I probably attempted 15 tacks and failed all of them. All apart from 3 tacks I have fallen into the water and during those 3 I came to complete stop but stayed on the board. With the absence of success I count those 3 as minor progress :). 

This session I used the built in Samsung app to track it. Previously I was using Windsurfing settings but this time I figured out that you can do a generic workout tracking and configure the phone to record gps and heart rate. At the end of the session it gives you total distance, the speed graph and the heart rate graph as well as time splits for each km. It was actually better than the Surfr app that I bought subscription to so I unsubscribed from it. I've heard some other apps can give more wingfoiling specific data like % of successfully executed tacks/jibes. But neither Surfr or the built-in app don't.
