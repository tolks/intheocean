It's been the longest streak without getting in the ocean. There was a bit of a wind but not enough for foiling. I took my scateboard and the wing and went to the Hefron park for a session of skate winging. There was a guy there on the skates; he was very fascinated by the wing. He even came over to ask if people could use wing with skates. 

It was a good session but not as exciting as wing foiling. There is a forecast for good wind tomorrow and I am looking forward to it.
