Today my mom and me went to Little Bay for a swim. It was a very hot day with very little wind and even though it was a weekday quite a few people were on the beach. I had a slightly longer swim than usual -- 2 laps up and down that small beach. The forecast predicts rain from tomorrow till the end of the week. Hopefully I would still find a chance to get on the water.
