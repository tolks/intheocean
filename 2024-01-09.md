Today I had an extra long wing foiling session. It was a southerly wind and I went to La Perouse. The big advantage of La Perouse is not having to deal with jelly fish; there are none of them there. The disadvantage is a high chop that makes it difficult to get on foil unless there are strong winds; performing manoeuvres in the chop becomes more tricky too. Fortunately the wind was strong and I was practicing jibing quite a bit. I am getting better and was able to get 25% of jibes executed even in chop. 
The session wasn't supposed to be 3hours+ long but a tiny confusion made me think that it was shorter than it really was. I started a "kitesurfing" workout on my watch when I got into the water. The watch tracks the time and the heart rate during the workout. As I got a bit tired and looked at the watch it said I have only been in the water for 20 min so I continued. Only later when I got out and looked at the time I realised the workout must have been paused and then re-started making the total time in the water of 3h15min. I was quite tired at the end but with the harness it wasn't too exhausting. If the wind is good tomorrow I think I will be able to do another session.
